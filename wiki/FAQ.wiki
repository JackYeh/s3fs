== subheading 1 ==

*Are there restrictions on bucket names?*

Yes. Upper case characters are not supported by s3fs even though allowable by AWS. See issue #98 and issue #126

*Is s3fs compatible with other S3 clients?*

No. This mainly has to do with how directories are represented -- each client has adopted its own method. Another incompatibility is with how use client utilized the metadata associated with the file -- permissions, ownership, modification times are likely to be incoherent.
